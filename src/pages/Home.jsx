        <p className="w-full sm:w-3/4 mx-auto text-center text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl">
          Mockups are visual representations or prototypes of a product,
          typically used in design and development processes to showcase how a
          final product will look and function. They help in communicating
          design ideas, gathering feedback, and aligning the team on the
          project's direction.

          Mockups are a key asset for presenting your design work in a polished and professional manner.
          Instead of just showcasing raw designs, mockups allow you to place them in realistic settings, 
          such as on devices or products, making them more visually engaging.

          Client Presentations
        </p>
        <p className="w-4/5 sm:w-3/4 mx-auto text-md sm:text-lg">
        In client presentations, mockups serve as a powerful tool for conveying your design vision in a tangible way. 
        Clients are often more likely to approve designs when they can visualize how the final product will look in a 
        real-world context, and mockups provide just that. By inserting your designs into mockups, you can showcase them 
        in environments like mobile screens, posters, or packaging, making it easier for clients to grasp the designâ€™s functionality and appeal.

          Speed Up Design Process
        </p>
        <p className="w-4/5 sm:w-3/4 mx-auto text-md sm:text-lg">
        Mockups can significantly speed up the design process by helping designers catch errors early. 
        When designs are inserted into mockups, it becomes easier to spot issues like incorrect aspect ratios, 
        font sizes, or color mismatches that might not be apparent in a design file. 
        This allows for quick adjustments before moving on to final production, preventing costly revisions later.

        <p className="w-4/5 sm:w-3/4 mx-auto text-md sm:text-lg">
        In e-commerce, mockups are invaluable for displaying products online before they are physically produced. 
        With mockups, you can create high-quality visuals of your product packaging, clothing designs, or 
        even digital goods, and display them on your website or social media platforms. 
        This allows you to market and sell products before they are manufactured, giving you a head start on generating interest and revenue.

        <p className="w-4/5 sm:w-3/4 mx-auto text-md sm:text-lg">
        Mockups play a crucial role in creating high-quality advertising materials with minimal effort. 
        Once a design is finalized, it can be easily inserted into a mockup to create professional visuals for use in ads, 
        social media posts, or promotional materials. This allows you to quickly produce eye-catching graphics that are 
        ready for deployment without the need for complex photography or additional editing.
